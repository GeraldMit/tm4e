#### Improve logging mechanism

Most TM4E API entry-points can now be configured with a specific logger. That allows embedders (like the Eclipse UI plugin) to pass a specific logger so TM4E can log at the same location as other parts of the application that includes it, or enable some totally different logging is it fits better.

In Eclipse IDE, the logger takes the "trace" settings into account and logs in the usual Eclipse logs.
